# c1: Benchmarking and Profiling

how to assess the performance of Python programs & how to identify and isolate the slow sections of your code.

## 1 designing your application

Make in run, make in right (re-factoring), make it fast (optimization), in that order.

Visualize the simulation, run:

```bash
python .\book\c1\particle_simul.py
```

## 2 writing tests and benchmarks

## 3 writing better tests and benchmarks with `pytest-benchmark`

## 4 finding bottlenecks with `cProfile`

## 5 optimizing your code

## 6 using `dis` module

## 7 profiling memory usage with `memory_profiler`
